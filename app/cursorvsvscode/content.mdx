**hello ðŸ‘‹**
<br/>

_my thoughts on cursor and vscode._

<br />

<p>
  honestly speaking ive been using both cursor and vscode for the past month.
  VSCode for my entire career and cursor for 1 month that is checking it out and
  honestly speaking
</p>

<br/>
**im impressed**

<br/>

<p>
    I love _vscode_ and have used it for the past 3 years without changing. Obviously I use the "**vim extension...**" im not a weirdo or anything but debugging code takes so long cuz im constantly switching between vscode and stackoverflow.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    **I discovered cursor from my ex employer lol.**
</p>

<br/>

<p>
    And honestly I have to thank the guy cuz cursor is just **_soooooo_ "ðŸ¤Œ"**
</p>
