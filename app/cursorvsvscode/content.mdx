**hello ðŸ‘‹**

<br />

_my thoughts on cursor and vscode._

<br />

<p>
  honestly speaking ive been using both cursor and vscode for the past month.
  VSCode for my entire career and cursor for 1 month that is checking it out and
  honestly speaking
</p>

<br />
**im impressed**

<br />

<p>
  I love _vscode_ and have used it for the past 3 years without changing.
  Obviously I use the "**vim extension...**" im not a weirdo or anything but
  debugging code takes so long cuz im constantly switching between vscode and
  stackoverflow.
</p>

<br />

<p>**I discovered cursor from my ex employer lol.**</p>

<br />

<p>
  And honestly I have to thank the guy cuz cursor is just **_soooooo_ "ðŸ¤Œ"**
</p>

<br />

<p>

The best parts of cursor is the ai dude. **NO SHIT LMAO**. jokes aside it is just so well made it helps me with so much and im always in my editor and get high quality work done in less time
I love that it also gives suggestions to make my shitty code even better.

</p>
