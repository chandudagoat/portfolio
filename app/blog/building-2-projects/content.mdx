**hello ðŸ‘‹** writing this in a rush but need to get this off my chest...

<br />

listening to _Husn_ on repeat while writing this lmao.

<br />

idk man life is moving on so fast...

<br />
building 2 projects simulaneously is so fun and stressful since both of them are
near and dear to me and do have lots of value as they both are saas (software as
a service)'s lmfao.

<br />
the thing i want to talk about here is not the stress that im getting from building
these... honestly i love building software / websites honestly programming is peace
to me so it doesnt bother me at all.

<br />
the thing im worried about is which one i should prioritize more... i mean i already
know the answer since one project has an entire team working on it while the other
is just a hobby project of mine which is honestly super useful

<br />
both products have good market value too.

<br />
its just that i want to work on both since both of them have different technical
challenges that ive never tackled which is what is truly exciting.

<br />
hmmmmm

<br />
ig ill work on the main thing the most since it is the one that has a full designated
team lmfao idk why but writing this is giving me less confusion than i had 20 mins
ago lmfao.

<br />
writing is goated.

<br />
ill most likely work on the second hobby project the same way as i am with the main
project but with less working hours

<br />
ill use it as a refresher on the main project so i dont get burnt out... yea thats
what ill do
