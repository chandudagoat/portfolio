# Django vs Flask

_take with a **grain of salt** cuz i like to meme alot_

Hello! welcome to this stupid attempt of me trying to *actually* write a blog.

Now today i'm just going to give my honest opinion about both flask and django.

I'm not going to **tell** u nerds what they are because you should probably already know what they are cuz u clicked this dumb link.

But they are **PYTHON WEB FRAMEWORKS** for building apis and stuff.

So i've used both django and flask for both hobby and serious projects and I have to say both are phenomenol when it comes to smoothness of programming.

They both are very elegant.

Flask with its simplicity and ease of starting a new project is just wonderful.

just like 3 commands and like 20 lines of code and you have an api ready to go

```
1. virtualenv env # only real programmers use virtual environments

2. pip install flask

3. some code

4. execute
```

```
GET http://127.0.0.1/5000
"ur mom"
```

Amazing.

But when it comes to building big ass apps with multiple
api routes and alot of db work flask tends to get really 
messy.

I have also found it really difficult to host flask
other than pythonanywhere and pythonanywhere is jack 
shit...

Django.... mmmmm i love django *sniffs intensely*. 
Django is really good when it comes to big ass projects.

What i really love about django is that you can achieve most things in just one django project instead 
seperating it into different pieces like we do for flask.

all the db work, api stuff, serializers, etc, are dealt with in one project 


Anyways thats my small rant on this topic. I just wanted to write this blog since i'm mainly **bored** and it took me way longer than i had hoped to get this markdown thing working so yea

I must enjoy the fruits of my labour.

But on a small note i did make this blog just to reflect on my journey and to flex my english skills on u nerds.

Get GUD.

PEACE
